# Gorgeous Girlies Sandwich Shop- Point of Sales Application
Welcome to the Gorgeous Girlies Sandwich Shop Point of Sales (POS) Application! This application is designed to streamline the ordering process for our custom sandwich shop. With this POS system, customers can easily create and customize their sandwich orders, choose add-ons like drinks and chips, and complete their orders efficiently.
